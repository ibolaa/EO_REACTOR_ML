Due to water formation caused by step-growth polymerization from oxidation of ethylene for producing Ethylene Oxide, main product interacts with water and produces heavier glycols. 
This projects aim is to predict composition of glycols by utilizing the realtionship between each glycols' kinetics. 

(Ethylene Oxide--->Monoethylene Glycol,
Monoethylene Glycol--->Diethylene Glycol, 
Diethylene Glycol--->Triethylene Glycol,
